# hello-world
my first repository for test files
a bit about myself... im learning matlab an python lenguages. I have never enjoyed quite a lot programming because I belive that programming has not been invented yet. There should be an universal language. I have the logic because I have programmed before (R, visaul basic, SAS) but I dont like to learn the names of the same function in different lenguages. The good thing is that programming likes me.
